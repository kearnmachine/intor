An android indoor positioning application.

The current state of this project represents not a finished or released end-user application. At the moment there is code for communicating with Bluetooth beacons and rendering these and their from RSSI converted distances on the screen.

The future goal of this project is to implement detailed indoor positioning that can serve as event source for home automation.

This project's focus is on local estimation of the indoor position without using any other infrastructure - except of beacons/WiFi signals. There should not be any connection to the internet necessary to ensure it's users privacy. It was also a goal not to use any beacon-manufacturer framework.

This is the software I have written to support my bachelor theses at the [Technikum Wien](http://http://www.technikum-wien.at) called "Evaluierung und Implementierung einer Android Applikation zur Ortung innerhalb von Geb√§uden" (Evaluation and implementation of an android indoor positioning application). This software served as tool for measurements and was developed to evaluate the necessaries for local indoor positioning.
